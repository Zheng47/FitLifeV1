                • 1 tbsp cooking oil <br />
                • 4 cloves garlic, minced <br />
                • 1 small onion, sliced <br />
                • 1 block (250g) firm tofu, cubed (optional, for protein) <br />
                • 1 carrot, julienned <br />
                • 1/2 small cabbage, shredded <br />
                • 1 cup green beans (baguio beans) or string beans (sitaw), sliced diagonally <br />
                • 4-5 cups vegetable broth <br />
                • 1 package (about 227g / 8oz) bihon noodles (rice vermicelli), soaked in water as per package directions, then drained <br />
                • 1/4 cup soy sauce (ensure vegan, check for fish ingredients if unsure) <br />
                • Salt and black pepper to taste <br />
                • Optional: Sliced bell peppers, celery, snow peas (sitsaro) <br />
                • Garnish: Chopped spring onions, fried garlic bits, calamansi wedges <br />

            <label>Instructions</label>
            <div>
                <p>
                1. Heat oil in a large wok or pot over medium heat. If using tofu, fry until golden brown, then set aside. <br/> <br />
                2. Sauté garlic and onion until fragrant. <br/> <br />
                3. Add carrots and green beans. Stir-fry for 2-3 minutes. <br/> <br />
                4. Add cabbage and any other chosen vegetables (bell peppers, celery, snow peas). Stir-fry for another 2-3 minutes until vegetables are tender-crisp. <br/> <br />
                5. Pour in the vegetable broth and soy sauce. Bring to a boil. <br/> <br />
                6. Add the soaked and drained bihon noodles to the pot. Toss gently to coat the noodles with the sauce and mix with vegetables. Add the fried tofu back in. <br/> <br />
                7. Cook, tossing frequently, until the noodles have absorbed most of the liquid and are cooked through (about 5-10 minutes). If it gets too dry, add a little more broth or water. <br/> <br />
                8. Season with salt (if needed) and black pepper to taste. <br/> <br />
                9. Transfer to a serving platter. Garnish with spring onions, fried garlic, and serve with calamansi wedges on the side.

                    For the Filling: <br />
                    • 1 tbsp cooking oil <br/>
                    • 3 cloves garlic, minced <br />
                    • 1 small onion, chopped <br />

                    • 1 cup bean sprouts (togue) <br />
                    • 1/2 cup chopped green beans <br/> <br />

                    • Salt and pepper to taste <br />
                    • 1 tbsp soy sauce (ensure vegan) <br/>
                    <br />

                    For Wrapping: <br />
                    • 1 package (approx. 25-30 sheets) spring roll wrappers (lumpia wrappers - check ingredients to ensure vegan, most common ones are) <br />
                    • Water or a cornstarch slurry (1 tsp cornstarch + 2 tbsp water) for sealing <br /> <br />

                    For Frying: <br />
                    • Cooking oil for deep frying (about 2-3 cups) <br />
                    • For Vegan Dipping Sauce: <br />
                    • 1/4 cup vinegar (cane or white) <br />
                    • 2 cloves garlic, minced <br />
                    • 1 small chili (siling labuyo), chopped (optional) <br />
                    • Pinch of salt and sugar <br />
                    • Black pepper <br />

            <div>
                <p>
                    1. Make the Filling: Heat 1 tbsp oil in a pan. Sauté garlic and onion. Add carrots and green beans, cook for 3 minutes. Add cabbage and cook for 2 minutes. Add bean sprouts and optional kamote/tofu. Stir-fry until vegetables are tender-crisp (don't overcook). Season with soy sauce, salt, and pepper. Let the filling cool completely. Drain any excess liquid. <br />  <br />
                    2. Assemble the Lumpia: Lay a wrapper flat on a surface (like a diamond shape). Place about 2 tablespoons of the cooled filling near one corner. Fold the corner over the filling. Fold in the two side corners. Roll tightly towards the opposite corner. Seal the edge with a dab of water or cornstarch slurry. Repeat with remaining filling and wrappers. <br /> <br />
                    3. Fry the Lumpia: Heat oil for deep frying in a wok or deep pan to about 350°F (175°C). Carefully slide the lumpia into the hot oil (fry in batches, don't overcrowd). Fry for 3-5 minutes, turning occasionally, until golden brown and crispy. <br /> <br />
                    4. Drain and Serve: Remove lumpia using a slotted spoon and drain on paper towels. <br /> <br />
                    5. Make the Dipping Sauce: Combine vinegar, minced garlic, chili (if using), salt, sugar, and pepper in a small bowl. Stir well. <br /> <br />
                    6. Serve lumpia hot with the dipping sauce.

                <p>
                    • 100g dried taro leaves (dahon ng gabi) <br />
                    • 2 cans (400ml each) full-fat coconut milk (gata) <br />
                    • 1 can (400ml) coconut cream (kakang gata - the thicker cream, often sold separately or skimmed from the top of canned milk left overnight in the fridge) <br />
                    • 1 tbsp cooking oil <br />
                    • 5-6 cloves garlic, minced <br />
                    • 1 large onion, chopped <br />
                    • 2-3 thumb-sized pieces of ginger, sliced or minced <br />
                    • 3-5 red or green chilies (siling labuyo or siling haba), chopped (adjust to desired spiciness) <br />
                    • 1 stalk lemongrass (tanglad), bruised/pounded (optional, for fragrance) <br />
                    • Salt to taste (you'll need a fair amount to compensate for no bagoong) <br /> <br />
                    • Optional: 1 block firm tofu, cubed and fried, or smoked tofu for added flavor/texture

            <div>
                <p>
                    1. Prepare Taro Leaves: Briefly rinse the dried taro leaves. Some prefer to soak them slightly, but cooking them directly in coconut milk works well. Do not stir excessively initially. <br /> <br />
                    2. Sauté Aromatics: Heat oil in a large pot. Sauté garlic, onion, and ginger until fragrant. <br /> <br />
                    3. Combine & Simmer: Add the 2 cans of regular coconut milk, dried taro leaves, chilies, and lemongrass (if using). Bring to a simmer. Important: Do not stir for the first 10-15 minutes. Let the leaves cook down gently. <br /> <br />
                    4. Slow Cook: Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer gently for at least 30-45 minutes, or until the taro leaves are very tender and have absorbed the coconut milk. Stir occasionally after the initial 15 minutes. If it becomes too dry, add a little water or more coconut milk. <br />
                    5. Add Cream & Season: Once the leaves are tender, pour in the coconut cream (kakang gata). Add fried/smoked tofu if using. Stir well. <br /> <br />
                    6. Reduce: Continue simmering, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens considerably and the oil starts to separate from the coconut milk (about 15-20 more minutes). <br /> <br />
                    7. Season: Season generously with salt to taste. The dish should be creamy, slightly spicy, and savory. Remove lemongrass stalk before serving.
                    8. Serve hot with steamed rice.
