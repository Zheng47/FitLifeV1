                • Cooking oil for frying <br />
                • 1 tbsp butter or margarine <br />
                • 1 large red onion, finely chopped <br />
                • 3-5 bird's eye chilies (siling labuyo), finely chopped (adjust to taste) <br />
                • 3 cloves garlic, minced (optional) <br />
                • 1/4 cup mayonnaise (ensure no meat broth added if concerned) <br />
                • 2 tbsp soy sauce <br />
                • 1 tbsp calamansi juice (or lemon juice) <br />
                • Salt and pepper to taste <br />  <br />

            <div>
                <p>
                1. Fry the boneless bangus in hot oil until cooked through, golden brown, and crispy. Let it cool slightly. <br />  <br />
                2. Flake the cooked bangus meat, discarding the skin (or chop the crispy skin finely and add it in if desired). <br />  <br />
                3. In a pan or wok, melt the butter/margarine over medium heat. <br />  <br />
                4. Add the chopped onions and chilies (and garlic, if using). Sauté until onions are softened and translucent (about 5 minutes). <br />  <br />
                5. Add the flaked bangus meat to the pan. Stir well. <br />  <br />
                6. In a small bowl, combine the mayonnaise, soy sauce, and calamansi juice. Pour this mixture over the bangus. <br />  <br />
                7. Stir everything together and cook for another 2-3 minutes until heated through. Season with salt and pepper to taste. <br />  <br />
                8. For Sizzling Plate (Optional): Heat a cast iron sizzling plate until very hot. Add a little oil or butter. Pour the bangus sisig onto the hot plate (it should sizzle!). Crack a raw egg on top if desired. <br />  <br />
                9. Garnish with spring onions and serve immediately with calamansi wedges on the side. If not using a sizzling plate, serve hot directly from the pan.

                <p>
                1. Season the tilapia generously with salt and pepper. Optional: Lightly fry the fish in oil until slightly browned on both sides, then set aside (this helps it hold shape). <br />  <br />
                2. In the same pot or a clean one, heat 1-2 tbsp oil. Sauté garlic, onion, and ginger until fragrant (about 2-3 minutes). <br />  <br />
                3. Pour in the coconut milk and water/broth. Add the long green chilies. Bring to a gentle simmer. <br />  <br />
                4. Carefully add the seasoned tilapia (fried or raw) to the pot. Ensure it's mostly submerged in the liquid. <br />  <br />
                5. Simmer gently (do not boil rapidly) for 10-15 minutes, or until the fish is cooked through. Spoon some sauce over the fish occasionally. <br />  <br />
                6. Add the pechay or mustasa leaves on top. Cover and cook for another 2-3 minutes until the greens are wilted but still vibrant.
                7. Season the sauce with fish sauce (patis) or salt to taste.
                8. Serve hot with steamed rice.
