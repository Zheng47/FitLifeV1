                • 2 large Chinese eggplants (talong) <br />
                • 2 large eggs <br />
                • 2 cloves garlic, minced <br />
                • 1 small onion, finely chopped (optional) <br />
                • Salt and pepper to taste <br />
                • 2-3 tbsp cooking oil (vegetable or coconut) <br />

                1. Grill or broil the eggplants until the skin is charred and the flesh is very soft. Alternatively, boil them until tender. <br />  <br />
                2. Let the eggplants cool slightly. Carefully peel off the charred skin, leaving the stem intact if possible (for easier handling). <br />  <br />
                3. Gently flatten the eggplant flesh using a fork, keeping it in one piece. <br />  <br />
                4. In a bowl, beat the eggs well. Season with salt, pepper, minced garlic, and chopped onion (if using). <br />  <br />
                5. Dip the flattened eggplant into the beaten egg mixture, ensuring it's fully coated. <br />  <br />
                6. Heat the cooking oil in a frying pan over medium heat. <br />  <br />
                7. Carefully place the egg-coated eggplant in the hot pan. Pour a little extra egg mixture over it if needed. <br />  <br />
                8. Fry for 3-5 minutes per side, until the egg is cooked, golden brown, and slightly crispy. <br />  <br />
                9. Serve hot with steamed rice and your preferred dip. <br />  <br />

                1. If using tofu, fry the cubed tofu in a separate pan until golden brown and slightly crispy. Set aside. <br />  <br />
                2. Heat oil in a pot or wok over medium heat. Sauté garlic, onion, and ginger until fragrant (about 2-3 minutes). <br />  <br />

                4. Add the string beans (sitaw) and cook for another 3 minutes. <br />  <br />
                5. Pour in the coconut milk and vegetable broth (or water). Bring to a gentle simmer (do not boil vigorously, as coconut milk can curdle). <br />  <br />
                6. Add the fried tofu (if using) and green chilies (if using). <br />  <br />
                7. Simmer gently for 10-15 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender but not mushy. <br />  <br />

                • 2 tbsp cooking oil <br />
                • 500g mixed mushrooms (button, shiitake, oyster), cleaned and sliced or halved if large <br />
                • 2 medium potatoes, peeled and cubed <br />
                • 6-8 cloves garlic, crushed <br />
                • 1/2 cup soy sauce (toyo) <br />
                • 1/4 cup white vinegar (suka) <br />
                • 1 cup water or vegetable broth <br />
                • 1 tsp whole black peppercorns <br />
                • 2-3 bay leaves (dahon ng laurel) <br /> <br />
                Optional: 1 tbsp brown sugar (to balance flavors) <br />
                Optional garnish: Fried garlic bits or chopped spring onions

                <p>
                1. Heat oil in a pot or pan over medium-high heat. Add the potatoes and fry lightly until the edges start to brown slightly (about 5 minutes). Remove potatoes and set aside. <br />  <br />
                2. In the same pot, add the mushrooms and cook until they release their water and start to brown (about 5-7 minutes). <br />  <br />
                3. Add the crushed garlic and sauté until fragrant (about 1 minute). <br />  <br />
                4. Return the potatoes to the pot. Pour in the soy sauce, vinegar, and water/broth. <br />  <br />
                5. Add the whole peppercorns and bay leaves. Add brown sugar if desired. <br />  <br />
                6. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat, cover, and simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the potatoes are tender and the sauce has slightly thickened. Avoid stirring for the first 5-10 minutes after adding vinegar to let it cook off properly. <br />  <br />
                7. Taste and adjust seasoning if needed (more soy sauce for saltiness, a bit more sugar for balance). <br />  <br />
                8. Serve hot with steamed rice, garnished with fried garlic or spring onions if desired.
